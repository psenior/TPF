          <strong>The Problem</strong><br>
          Statistics from the Department of Education, the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) and the US Census Bureau all show that our country spends an enormous amount of money trying to educate our children. In 2010, that amount topped 600 billion dollars, more than we spent on our nation's defense, and averaged over $10,000 per student. We spend more per student than any other country except Switzland according to a 2005 study from the OECD. You would think, based on our expenditures, that we would educate our children better than any other nation. Yet, our children rank 17th in the developed world for education, according to a report published by the Pearson education firm. 
          </p> 
        <p class="col-md-6">
          <strong>The Results Don't Match the Costs</strong><br>
          Our failure to provide an education to our chidren that is commensurate with our expenditures is felt hardest in our poorest performing schools, primarily in low-income areas. Advocates of public education insist the solution can be found in spending even more money. Meanwhile, wealthy and powerful Americans remove their children from the public school system and enroll them in private institutions where, statistically, the quality of education is much greater and the children do much better. Children from lower-income families, unable to afford the better educational opportunities provided at private schools, are trapped in poorly performing public schools. Without a good education and the high self-esteem and confidence such an education provides, the liberties and opportunities these children are destined to enjoy in adulthood are severely limited.
        </p>
        <p class="col-md-6">
          <strong>Our Solution</strong><br>
          Tina's Fund is designed to level the playing field. It is a scholarship fund, given to deserving students in the elementary and secondary school levels in Florida's Broward county, to allow them to escape the poorly performing public schools in which they are trapped by paying their tuition to attend better performing private schools. Children at all grade levels from kindergarden to high school seniors are eligible.  
        </p>
        <p class="col-md-6">
          <strong>What the Award Provides</strong><br>
          The Tina's Fund award is a one-year scholarship award. It pays 100% of the required expenses for one year at the school of choice. Required expenses usually include the tuition and required fees. It also provides up to 20% of the required expenses for optional expenses. So, if the recipient wished to join a club or play a sport, the expenses related to those optional programs may also be paid as long as the total cost of those optional programs does not exceed 20% of the required expenses. 
        </p>
        <p class="col-md-6">
          <strong>Requirements</strong><br>
          The Tina's Fund award is a needs-based award. A financial need must be provided. Preference is given to applicants who have already been accepted into the school of choice.

          <strong>The Problem</strong><br>
          Many women find themselves trapped in abusive relationships. Without the job skills needed to support themselves, they are dependent on their abusers and unable to leave the relationships. Liberty and opportunity may only exist where the people are able to live independently. Dependency, on the other hand, fosters subjugation. It stands to reason that those who are dependent on others lack power and authority and are more easily subjugated. In order for women to gain greater independence, liberty and opportunity, they must break these bonds of dependency and be able to support themselves on their own merits. Self-esteem and education are the ingredients necessary to make this dream a reality. 
        </p>
        <p class="col-md-6">
          <strong>Our Solution</strong><br>
          It is for these women that the Hope Of Faith program exists. The goal of the program is to increase the liberty of these women by breaking the bonds of dependency that lead to abusive relationships. This is done by providing adequate job training and education to women so that they are able to support themselves without having to rely so much on other people. We, at the Piasecki Foundation, believe that, once a woman possesses the self-esteem and education necessary to support herself, she will be better able to choose those with whom she will have relationships. And, if she finds herself in an abusive relationship, she will be better equipped to voluntarily leave that relationship. It is through education, job training and greater self-esteem that the dependency and abuse can be ended and greater liberty can be attained.
        </p>
        <p class="col-md-6">
          <strong>What the Award Provides</strong><br>
          Recipients of a Hope Of Faith award are provided guidance and consultation concerning a career path. An educational program is then chosen that will provide the necessary training and knowledge necessary to achieve that career goal. The Hope Of Faith award pays 100% of the required expenses related to the chosen educational program. 
        </p>
        <p class="col-md-6">
          <strong>Requirements</strong><br>
          The Hope Of Faith award is a needs-based award. A financial need must be provided. In addition, it is beneficial, though not required, for the applicant to articulate a clear career goal. Preference is given to career goals that can be obtained quickly with minimal education. The Hope Of Faith award is not intended to be a means by which to obtain a college degree, for example, It is intended to be a job training program. The faster a woman is able to secure the training and confidence necessary to provide for herself, the faster the bonds of dependency can be broken.

          <strong>The Problem</strong><br>
          Children with low self-esteem and a lack of confidence in their ability to achieve academic success will not achieve it. Many of these children simply stop trying, convinced that their efforts will be in vain. These are the children that fall through the cracks and eventually drop out of school. Lacking the knowledge and academic credentials necessary to be successful in our modern society, they become the most vulnerable of adults, dependent on society and more likely to fall into lives of crime. To promote the liberty of these children so that they may grow into adulthood to enjoy all the opportunities our nation provides, they must be convinced at the earliest age possible that they can achieve academic success.
